# Eye-tracker data extraction

The currently supported eye-trackers are listed here:
```{tableofcontents}
```
We will add other eye-trackers in the near future, so stay tuned!

If your eye-tracker is not listed, no worries!
To add a new eye-tracker, you can contact the developer by opening an issue on 
[GitHub](www.github.com/EveCharbie/EyeDentify3d/issues) including the documentation of your eye-tracker where the axis 
of rotation are clearly identified and a data sample where the wearer 
1) looks straight ahead, 
2) looks upward using eye and neck movements, 
3) looks straight ahead, 
4) looks to the right using eye and neck movements, 
5) looks straight ahead, 
6) blinks a few times, and 
7) makes a few clockwise rotations with the eyes only.
