# EyeDentify3D: A Python package for gaze behavior classification from 3D eye-tracking data

Welcome to the official documentation for [EyeDentify3D](https://github.com/EveCharbie/EyeDentify3d)! 
We hope that this documentation will help you get started with this package. The aim of EyeDentify3D is to provide a 
simple and user-friendly way to extract gaze behaviors from 3D eye-tracking data. If you are looking for the gaze 
behavior definitions and how they are practically extracted, you can go to the 
[gaze behavior identification](behavior_identification/index.md) section. If you are looking for examples of how to use 
the package, you might prefer starting with the [examples](examples/index.md) section. If you want to know if your 
eye-tracker is currently supported, you can have a look at the [eye-tracker data](data_parsing/index.md) section.

## Installation
You can install EyeDentify3D using pip. Simply run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install eyedentify3d
``` 
or conda-forge:
```bash 
conda install -c conda-forge eyedentify3d
```

## Questions and contributions
If you have any questions, need help using the package, or have feature requests, please feel free to open an issue on 
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EveCharbie/EyeDentify3d). If you would like to contribute to the development 
of the package, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Any contribution would be welcomed!
