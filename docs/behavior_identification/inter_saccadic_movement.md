# Inter-saccadic sequences detection

```{admonition} Inter-saccadic sequence definition
An inter-saccadic sequence is not a gaze behavior. The remaining frames between 
previously identified gaze behaviors are split into coherent or incoherent inter-saccadic sequences.
```

## Implementation
All frames that have not been identified yet are split into windows that are overlapping a little bit at the beginning and end.
The coherence of the gaze movements inside each window is assessed using a Rayleigh z-test. 
First, the gaze movement is extracted by computing the gaze endpoint displacement vector between consecutive frames.
Then, the angle formed by the gaze end point movement and a specified axis is computed. 
A Rayleigh z-test is performed on this angle to determine if the gaze movement is coherent (i.e., the p-value is smaller than eta_p), meaning that the gaze is moving in a particular direction.
As there is an overlap between the windows, the mean p-values across all windows in which it was part of is used to determine the coherence of this frame.
The adjacent coherent (or incoherent) windows are merged to form larger coherent (or incoherent) sequences {cite}`Larsson:2015`.
These sequences are then each analyzed to determine if they should be identified as a fixation, sequence, or undefined sequence by computing four parameters {cite}`Larsson:2015`.
    1) Dispersion: Measures if the segment is more dispersed in one direction than in the other (ratio between the lengths of the first and the second principal components of the gaze positions decomposition). 
    2) Direction consistency: Measures if the segment is consistently moving in one direction (ratio between the gaze displacement over the sequence and the length of the first principal components of the gaze positions decomposition).
    3) Positional displacement: Measures if the displacement over the segment is mainly due to coherent gaze movements (ratio between the gaze displacement over the sequence and the gaze trajectory length over the sequence).
    4) Spatial range: Measures the spatial extent of the segment (the diameter of the average circle containing all gaze points).
See the sections [fixation](fixation.md) and [smooth_pursuit](smooth_pursuit.md) detection sections for their interpretation.

## Limitation
The computation of the gaze movement angle only works if it is possible to predict on which axis the gaze will move during the trial (e.g., when following a freeze-bee the gaze movement should be mainly horizontal).
If you need to extract intersaccadic sequences, fixations, or saccades from your trials and you cannot predict the axis on which the gaze will be moving the most, please notify the developer by opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/EveCharbie/EyeDentify3d/issues).

## Parameters
- `window_duration (float)`: The length of the windows. The default is `0.022` s.
- `window_overlap (float)`: The duration by which the windows must overlap at their extremities. The default is `0.006` s.
- `minimal_duration (float)`: The minimal duration for which the gaze behavior must be consistent or inconsistent to consider the inter-saccadic interval. The default is `0.04` s.
- `eta_p (float)`: The maximal p-value to consider a sequence as incoherent. The default is `0.001`.
- `eta_d (float)`: The minimal dispersion. The default is `0.45`.
- `eta_cd (float)`: The maximal direction consistency. The default is `0.5`.
- `eta_pd (float)`: The maximal positional displacement. The default is `0.2`.
- `eta_max_fixation (float)`: The maximal fixation spatial range. The default is `1.9`°.
- `eta_min_smooth_pursuit (float)`: The minimal smooth pursuit spatial range. The default is `1.7`°.
- `phi (float)`: The maximal angular difference to consider two sequences to have a displacement in the same direction. The default is `45`°.
- `main_movement_axis (int)`: The axis on which the gaze is expected to move the most. The default is `0` (i.e., the x-axis).
